        <div class="about">
            <p class="text">Kim Ki-Duk (December 20, 1960 - December 11, 2020) was a South Korean film director,
                screenwriter, and producer. He was known for his idiosyncratic art-house films, which often explored
                themes of violence, sexuality, and spirituality. Kim's films have won numerous awards at film
                festivals
                around the world, including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for Pieta (2012).
